- **[`Toastify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toastify-js): This is a alert library where we can show colorful toast alert messages to the user**

## Installation:

Now to install these modules we need to first of all start a new electron.js project as shown below in the commands
```
npm init -y
```
First of all we have initialized the package.json file for our node.js project. Now it’s time to install the dependencies as shown below
```
npm i electron --save-dev
```
This will install the electron framework for developing desktop apps. And -dev flag is assigned because it’s a dev dependency because it’s only need in development not in production.
```
npm i resize-img
```
This is the module which will actually resize the images inside node.js and electron.
```
npm i toastify-js
```
This is the library for showing colorful alert toast messages to the user whether success and error.

If you want to run this Project, simply write this command on your machine to start the Electron JS with hot reload functionality so that whenever we make any kind of changes we don’t need to restart the server. You need to execute the below command as shown below

```
npx electronmon .
```
