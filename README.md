**`Image Resizer Desktop App` which Amazing tool for Everyone to use in their daily life for Free to use this Tool as a `Desktop OFFLINE App` which can easily `Resize any Good format Image` into `Desired Size Image` but if you give it wrong format then it has `Validation Built-in Functionality` which sees that if you have `Wrong or Correct Format Image` uploaded or `App will simply give you Colorful Alert Messages` for Confirmation and `Downloads your Image` automatically in a new Images Folder.**

## Introduction: 

**Image Resizer Desktop App which is built with `Node JS` Using [`Electron JS`](https://www.electronjs.org/) Framework & [`Toastify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toastify-js) Library**

## Materials Used: 

- **[`Electron JS`](https://www.electronjs.org/): It is an open source framework used in Node.js for developing Desktop Apps with the use of HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript.**

- **[`Toastify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toastify-js): This is a Alert Library where we can show Colorful Toast Alert Messages to the user**

## Installation:

Now to install these modules we need to first of all start a new electron.js project as shown below in the commands
```
npm init -y
```
First of all we have initialized the package.json file for our node.js project. Now it’s time to install the dependencies as shown below
```
npm i electron --save-dev
```
This will install the electron framework for developing desktop apps. And -dev flag is assigned because it’s a dev dependency because it’s only need in development not in production.
```
npm i resize-img
```
This is the module which will actually resize the images inside node.js and electron.
```
npm i toastify-js
```
This is the library for showing colorful alert toast messages to the user whether success and error.

If you want to run this Project, simply write this command on your machine to start the Electron JS with hot reload functionality so that whenever we make any kind of changes we don’t need to restart the server. You need to execute the below command as shown below

```
npx electronmon .
```
